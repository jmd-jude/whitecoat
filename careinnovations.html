                <div class="solution-box">
                    <p><strong>The core insight:</strong> Recent LLM breakthroughs aren't just impressive chatbots—they're powerful new interfaces to previously hard-to-access unstructured knowledge. The key is curating and preparing expert knowledge in ways that applications can deliver meaningful, personalized guidance at scale.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>How It Works</h3>

                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>Expert Knowledge Capture</h4>

                    <p><strong>Key Principle:</strong> We're not replacing human experts—we're amplifying their ability to help more people by making their expertise infinitely accessible while maintaining the quality and personalization of one-on-one consultation.</p>

                <h2>Real-World Example: IBD Nutrition Navigation</h2>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                    <p>Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients need highly personalized nutrition guidance, but dietitians with IBD expertise are scarce and expensive. Patients often wait months for appointments and struggle with generic advice that doesn't account for their specific symptoms, triggers, and lifestyle.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Our Solution</h3>
                    <p>Working with IBD nutrition specialists, we've created an AI-powered consultation experience that provides expert-level, personalized guidance in real-time:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Conducts thorough intake interviews accounting for individual symptoms and triggers</li>
                        <li>Provides personalized meal planning and nutrition strategies</li>
                        <li>Generates detailed action plans and monitoring tools</li>
                        <li>Adapts recommendations as patients track their progress</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>The Impact</h3>
                    <p>Rather than waiting months for specialist appointments or relying on generic online tools, patients receive immediate access to expert-level guidance that scales in ways that traditional one-on-one consultations simply cannot. This allows specialists to focus their direct time on the most complex cases requiring human intervention.</p>

                <h2>Potential Application: Medicaid Navigation</h2>
                
                <p>Medicaid systems share many characteristics that make them potentially well-suited for this approach:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Complex, context-specific rules:</strong> Eligibility requirements vary by state, family situation, income changes, and life circumstances</li>
                    <li><strong>High-stakes decisions:</strong> People need accurate guidance to access essential healthcare</li>
                    <li><strong>Existing expertise gap:</strong> There's a cottage industry of consultants and specialists, but not nearly enough to meet demand</li>
                    <li><strong>Equity imperative:</strong> Those who most need help often have least access to expert guidance</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Our preliminary testing with Massachusetts Medicaid data</strong> suggests the platform could effectively guide people through eligibility questions, application processes, and benefit navigation—potentially making expert-level assistance available to anyone who needs it.</p>

                <h2>Our Background</h2>
                <p>We're <strong>not</strong> healthcare or Medicaid experts. That's exactly why we're reaching out—we want to understand whether our technical approach could genuinely help address access challenges, and if so, how to do it in ways that center equity and serve the people who need it most.</p>
                
                <p>We're in early exploration mode, not sales mode. We're looking for conversations with people who understand these systems and can help us figure out if there's a meaningful opportunity to apply our platform for good.</p>
